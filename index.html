        <p>This capstone project aims at developing a mobile calendar application, which is highly customized for college students to manage their courses, lectures and tasks, as well as socializing with their classmates.</p>

<p>The output of this project is a mobile application, which is formerly called Timetable and is available in the Android platform. The applicationâ€™s source code and compiled binary image are provided as attachments to this report.</p>

<p>The development time for this project is 3 months with 4 MSIT-VLIS students working on it.</p>

<p>Nowadays, it is very common to have at least one calendar application installed on every mobile phone. However, it is still difficult for college students to find a calendar application which is exclusively designed to manager their class lectures and tasks. Most of the time, we manually export the semester calendar to some calendar application and manually manage tasks about the courses we are taking.</p>

<p>Besides, we have a natural desire to meet and make friends with our classmates as taking the same course is a strong signal that we share some common interests. In addition, a lot of coursework requires students to form groups and finish some project together. Thus we would like to have some social platform which could helps us know and communicate with our classmates better, instead of only having impressions on how they look like.</p>

<p>Given the fact most of the college students are full-time students, managing their courses, lectures and related tasks, along with socializing with classmates, would play a very important role in their daily lives. As a result, it is reasonable to expect that providing a customized mobile calendar application would be very attractive to these students and thus owns huge market potential.</p>

<p>Given the background and motivation described above, we would like to develop a mobile calendar application which is highly customized for college students. The application should be both a productive tool to help students manage their courses, lectures and tasks and a platform for them to meet and know classmates. </p>

<p>With this application, registered user could create their own school calendar, add courses, manage lectures and related tasks, etc. For each course, enrolled students are eligible to post relevant comments for the course. In addition, they can find other students who take the same class and add them as friends as well as chat with them. All these features together will provide an unprecedented new user experience.</p>
